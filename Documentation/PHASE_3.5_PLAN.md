# Phase 3.5: Production Readiness Gap Closure

## Overview
Before proceeding to Phase 4 (Production Optimizations), we need to address critical gaps that were identified but not fully implemented in earlier phases.

## Objectives
1. Complete Metal acceleration implementation
2. Enhance model management for production use
3. Re-integrate with PipelineKit
4. Establish comprehensive benchmarking

## Tasks

### 1. Complete Metal Implementation (2 days)
- [ ] Implement cosine similarity Metal kernel
- [ ] Add attention-weighted pooling support
- [ ] Add Metal-specific unit tests
- [ ] Add memory pressure handling for Metal buffers
- [ ] Benchmark GPU vs CPU performance

### 2. Production Model Management (3 days)
- [ ] Add persistent storage for model registry (CoreData/SQLite)
- [ ] Implement model signature verification
- [ ] Add model health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with telemetry system
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker for model failures
- [ ] Add model download/update capabilities

### 3. PipelineKit Re-integration (1 day)
- [ ] Monitor PipelineKit package for build fixes
- [ ] Re-enable PipelineKit dependency when ready
- [ ] Update command handlers for any API changes
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Update examples to use PipelineKit

### 4. Comprehensive Benchmarking (2 days)
- [ ] Create benchmark suite for all operations
- [ ] Add memory usage benchmarks
- [ ] Add latency distribution analysis
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Add device-specific benchmarks (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Success Criteria
- Metal acceleration shows >2x speedup for batch operations
- Model management handles 10+ concurrent versions efficiently
- PipelineKit integration passes all tests
- Benchmarks establish clear performance baselines
- Zero critical production readiness gaps

## Timeline
- Total: 8 days (can be done in parallel)
- Can be completed alongside early Phase 4 work

## Notes
- This phase ensures production readiness before optimization
- Addresses technical debt from rapid development
- Sets foundation for Phase 4 optimizations
